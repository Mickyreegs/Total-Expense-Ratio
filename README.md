# TER-ribly Financial TER Program

Welcome,

TER-ribly Financial is a Python terminal prgram, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The live version was deployed to Heroku via GitHub and can be found here:

Users must select a date range within 2024 and a TER is calculated for that date range based on the following:
<ul>
    <li>Average NAV
    <li>Fixed Expenses
    <li>Variable Expenses
    <li>Total Expenses
    <li>Day Count
</ul>
